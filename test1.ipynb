       " 'VOLUME I',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER I',\n",
       " 'Emma Woodhouse , handsome , clever , and rich , with a comfortable home and happy disposition , seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence ; and had lived nearly twenty - one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her .',\n",
       " \"She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate , indulgent father ; and had , in consequence of her sister ' s marriage , been mistress of his house from a very early period .\",\n",
       " 'Her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses ; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess , who had fallen little short of a mother in affection .',\n",
       " \"Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr . Woodhouse ' s family , less as a governess than a friend , very fond of both daughters , but particularly of Emma .\",\n",
       " 'Between _them_ it was more the intimacy of sisters .',\n",
       " \"Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess , the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint ; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away , they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached , and Emma doing just what she liked ; highly esteeming Miss Taylor ' s judgment , but directed chiefly by her own .\",\n",
       " \"The real evils , indeed , of Emma ' s situation were the power of having rather too much her own way , and a disposition to think a little too well of herself ; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments .\",\n",
       " 'The danger , however , was at present so unperceived , that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her .',\n",
       " 'Sorrow came -- a gentle sorrow -- but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness .-- Miss Taylor married .',\n",
       " \"It was Miss Taylor ' s loss which first brought grief .\",\n",
       " 'It was on the wedding - day of this beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance .',\n",
       " 'The wedding over , and the bride - people gone , her father and herself were left to dine together , with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening .',\n",
       " 'Her father composed himself to sleep after dinner , as usual , and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost .',\n",
       " 'The event had every promise of happiness for her friend .',\n",
       " \"Mr . Weston was a man of unexceptionable character , easy fortune , suitable age , and pleasant manners ; and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self - denying , generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the match ; but it was a black morning ' s work for her .\",\n",
       " 'The want of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day .',\n",
       " 'She recalled her past kindness -- the kindness , the affection of sixteen years -- how she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old -- how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health -- and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood .',\n",
       " \"A large debt of gratitude was owing here ; but the intercourse of the last seven years , the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed Isabella ' s marriage , on their being left to each other , was yet a dearer , tenderer recollection .\",\n",
       " 'She had been a friend and companion such as few possessed : intelligent , well - informed , useful , gentle , knowing all the ways of the family , interested in all its concerns , and peculiarly interested in herself , in every pleasure , every scheme of hers -- one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose , and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault .',\n",
       " 'How was she to bear the change ?-- It was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them ; but Emma was aware that great must be the difference between a Mrs . Weston , only half a mile from them , and a Miss Taylor in the house ; and with all her advantages , natural and domestic , she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude .',\n",
       " 'She dearly loved her father , but he was no companion for her .',\n",
       " 'He could not meet her in conversation , rational or playful .',\n",
       " 'The evil of the actual disparity in their ages ( and Mr . Woodhouse had not married early ) was much increased by his constitution and habits ; for having been a valetudinarian all his life , without activity of mind or body , he was a much older man in ways than in years ; and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable temper , his talents could not have recommended him at any time .',\n",
       " 'Her sister , though comparatively but little removed by matrimony , being settled in London , only sixteen miles off , was much beyond her daily reach ; and many a long October and November evening must be struggled through at Hartfield , before Christmas brought the next visit from Isabella and her husband , and their little children , to fill the house , and give her pleasant society again .',\n",
       " 'Highbury , the large and populous village , almost amounting to a town , to which Hartfield , in spite of its separate lawn , and shrubberies , and name , did really belong , afforded her no equals .',\n",
       " 'The Woodhouses were first in consequence there .',\n",
       " 'All looked up to them .',\n",
       " 'She had many acquaintance in the place , for her father was universally civil , but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for even half a day .',\n",
       " 'It was a melancholy change ; and Emma could not but sigh over it , and wish for impossible things , till her father awoke , and made it necessary to be cheerful .',\n",
       " 'His spirits required support .',\n",
       " 'He was a nervous man , easily depressed ; fond of every body that he was used to , and hating to part with them ; hating change of every kind .',\n",
       " \"Matrimony , as the origin of change , was always disagreeable ; and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter ' s marrying , nor could ever speak of her but with compassion , though it had been entirely a match of affection , when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too ; and from his habits of gentle selfishness , and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself , he was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them , and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield .\",\n",
       " 'Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could , to keep him from such thoughts ; but when tea came , it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner ,',\n",
       " '\" Poor Miss Taylor !-- I wish she were here again .',\n",
       " 'What a pity it is that Mr . Weston ever thought of her !\"',\n",
       " '\" I cannot agree with you , papa ; you know I cannot .',\n",
       " 'Mr . Weston is such a good - humoured , pleasant , excellent man , that he thoroughly deserves a good wife ;-- and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for ever , and bear all my odd humours , when she might have a house of her own ?\"',\n",
       " '\" A house of her own !-- But where is the advantage of a house of her own ?',\n",
       " 'This is three times as large .-- And you have never any odd humours , my dear .\"',\n",
       " '\" How often we shall be going to see them , and they coming to see us !-- We shall be always meeting !',\n",
       " '_We_ must begin ; we must go and pay wedding visit very soon .\"',\n",
       " '\" My dear , how am I to get so far ?',\n",
       " 'Randalls is such a distance .',\n",
       " 'I could not walk half so far .\"',\n",
       " '\" No , papa , nobody thought of your walking .',\n",
       " 'We must go in the carriage , to be sure .\"',\n",
       " '\" The carriage !',\n",
       " 'But James will not like to put the horses to for such a little way ;-- and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit ?\"',\n",
       " '\" They are to be put into Mr . Weston \\' s stable , papa .',\n",
       " 'You know we have settled all that already .',\n",
       " 'We talked it all over with Mr . Weston last night .',\n",
       " \"And as for James , you may be very sure he will always like going to Randalls , because of his daughter ' s being housemaid there .\",\n",
       " 'I only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else .',\n",
       " 'That was your doing , papa .',\n",
       " 'You got Hannah that good place .',\n",
       " 'Nobody thought of Hannah till you mentioned her -- James is so obliged to you !\"',\n",
       " '\" I am very glad I did think of her .',\n",
       " 'It was very lucky , for I would not have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account ; and I am sure she will make a very good servant : she is a civil , pretty - spoken girl ; I have a great opinion of her .',\n",
       " 'Whenever I see her , she always curtseys and asks me how I do , in a very pretty manner ; and when you have had her here to do needlework , I observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it .',\n",
       " 'I am sure she will be an excellent servant ; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see .',\n",
       " 'Whenever James goes over to see his daughter , you know , she will be hearing of us .',\n",
       " 'He will be able to tell her how we all are .\"',\n",
       " 'Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas , and hoped , by the help of backgammon , to get her father tolerably through the evening , and be attacked by no regrets but her own .',\n",
       " 'The backgammon - table was placed ; but a visitor immediately afterwards walked in and made it unnecessary .',\n",
       " \"Mr . Knightley , a sensible man about seven or eight - and - thirty , was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family , but particularly connected with it , as the elder brother of Isabella ' s husband .\",\n",
       " 'He lived about a mile from Highbury , was a frequent visitor , and always welcome , and at this time more welcome than usual , as coming directly from their mutual connexions in London .',\n",
       " \"He had returned to a late dinner , after some days ' absence , and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were well in Brunswick Square .\",\n",
       " 'It was a happy circumstance , and animated Mr . Woodhouse for some time .',\n",
       " 'Mr . Knightley had a cheerful manner , which always did him good ; and his many inquiries after \" poor Isabella \" and her children were answered most satisfactorily .',\n",
       " 'When this was over , Mr . Woodhouse gratefully observed , \" It is very kind of you , Mr . Knightley , to come out at this late hour to call upon us .',\n",
       " 'I am afraid you must have had a shocking walk .\"',\n",
       " '\" Not at all , sir .',\n",
       " 'It is a beautiful moonlight night ; and so mild that I must draw back from your great fire .\"',\n",
       " '\" But you must have found it very damp and dirty .',\n",
       " 'I wish you may not catch cold .\"',\n",
       " '\" Dirty , sir !',\n",
       " 'Look at my shoes .',\n",
       " 'Not a speck on them .\"',\n",
       " '\" Well !',\n",
       " 'that is quite surprising , for we have had a vast deal of rain here .',\n",
       " 'It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast .',\n",
       " 'I wanted them to put off the wedding .\"',\n",
       " '\" By the bye -- I have not wished you joy .',\n",
       " 'Being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling , I have been in no hurry with my congratulations ; but I hope it all went off tolerably well .',\n",
       " 'How did you all behave ?',\n",
       " 'Who cried most ?\"',\n",
       " '\" Ah !',\n",
       " 'poor Miss Taylor !',\n",
       " '\\' Tis a sad business .\"',\n",
       " '\" Poor Mr . and Miss Woodhouse , if you please ; but I cannot possibly say ` poor Miss Taylor .\\'',\n",
       " 'I have a great regard for you and Emma ; but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence !-- At any rate , it must be better to have only one to please than two .\"',\n",
       " '\" Especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful , troublesome creature !\"',\n",
       " 'said Emma playfully .',\n",
       " '\" That is what you have in your head , I know -- and what you would certainly say if my father were not by .\"',\n",
       " '\" I believe it is very true , my dear , indeed ,\" said Mr . Woodhouse , with a sigh .',\n",
       " '\" I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome .\"',\n",
       " '\" My dearest papa !',\n",
       " 'You do not think I could mean _you_ , or suppose Mr . Knightley to mean _you_ .',\n",
       " 'What a horrible idea !',\n",
       " 'Oh no !',\n",
       " 'I meant only myself .',\n",
       " 'Mr . Knightley loves to find fault with me , you know -- in a joke -- it is all a joke .',\n",
       " 'We always say what we like to one another .\"',\n",
       " 'Mr . Knightley , in fact , was one of the few people who could see faults in Emma Woodhouse , and the only one who ever told her of them : and though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself , she knew it would be so much less so to her father , that she would not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by every body .',\n",
       " '\" Emma knows I never flatter her ,\" said Mr . Knightley , \" but I meant no reflection on any body .',\n",
       " 'Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons to please ; she will now have but one .',\n",
       " 'The chances are that she must be a gainer .\"',\n",
       " '\" Well ,\" said Emma , willing to let it pass --\" you want to hear about the wedding ; and I shall be happy to tell you , for we all behaved charmingly .',\n",
       " 'Every body was punctual , every body in their best looks : not a tear , and hardly a long face to be seen .',\n",
       " 'Oh no ; we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart , and were sure of meeting every day .\"',\n",
       " '\" Dear Emma bears every thing so well ,\" said her father .',\n",
       " '\" But , Mr . Knightley , she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor , and I am sure she _will_ miss her more than she thinks for .\"',\n",
       " 'Emma turned away her head , divided between tears and smiles .',\n",
       " '\" It is impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion ,\" said Mr . Knightley .',\n",
       " '\" We should not like her so well as we do , sir , if we could suppose it ; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor \\' s advantage ; she knows how very acceptable it must be , at Miss Taylor \\' s time of life , to be settled in a home of her own , and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision , and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure .',\n",
       " 'Every friend of Miss Taylor must be glad to have her so happily married .\"',\n",
       " '\" And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me ,\" said Emma , \" and a very considerable one -- that I made the match myself .',\n",
       " 'I made the match , you know , four years ago ; and to have it take place , and be proved in the right , when so many people said Mr . Weston would never marry again , may comfort me for any thing .\"',\n",
       " 'Mr . Knightley shook his head at her .',\n",
       " 'Her father fondly replied , \" Ah !',\n",
       " 'my dear , I wish you would not make matches and foretell things , for whatever you say always comes to pass .',\n",
       " 'Pray do not make any more matches .\"',\n",
       " '\" I promise you to make none for myself , papa ; but I must , indeed , for other people .',\n",
       " 'It is the greatest amusement in the world !',\n",
       " 'And after such success , you know !-- Every body said that Mr . Weston would never marry again .',\n",
       " 'Oh dear , no !',\n",
       " 'Mr . Weston , who had been a widower so long , and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife , so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his friends here , always acceptable wherever he went , always cheerful -- Mr . Weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it .',\n",
       " 'Oh no !',\n",
       " 'Mr . Weston certainly would never marry again .',\n",
       " 'Some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed , and others of the son and the uncle not letting him .',\n",
       " 'All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject , but I believed none of it .',\n",
       " '\" Ever since the day -- about four years ago -- that Miss Taylor and I met with him in Broadway Lane , when , because it began to drizzle , he darted away with so much gallantry , and borrowed two umbrellas for us from Farmer Mitchell \\' s , I made up my mind on the subject .',\n",
       " 'I planned the match from that hour ; and when such success has blessed me in this instance , dear papa , you cannot think that I shall leave off match - making .\"',\n",
       " '\" I do not understand what you mean by ` success ,\\'\" said Mr . Knightley .',\n",
       " '\" Success supposes endeavour .',\n",
       " 'Your time has been properly and delicately spent , if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage .',\n",
       " \"A worthy employment for a young lady ' s mind !\",\n",
       " \"But if , which I rather imagine , your making the match , as you call it , means only your planning it , your saying to yourself one idle day , ` I think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr . Weston were to marry her ,' and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards , why do you talk of success ?\",\n",
       " 'Where is your merit ?',\n",
       " 'What are you proud of ?',\n",
       " 'You made a lucky guess ; and _that_ is all that can be said .\"',\n",
       " '\" And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess ?-- I pity you .-- I thought you cleverer -- for , depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck .',\n",
       " 'There is always some talent in it .',\n",
       " \"And as to my poor word ` success ,' which you quarrel with , I do not know that I am so entirely without any claim to it .\",\n",
       " 'You have drawn two pretty pictures ; but I think there may be a third -- a something between the do - nothing and the do - all .',\n",
       " \"If I had not promoted Mr . Weston ' s visits here , and given many little encouragements , and smoothed many little matters , it might not have come to any thing after all .\",\n",
       " 'I think you must know Hartfield enough to comprehend that .\"',\n",
       " '\" A straightforward , open - hearted man like Weston , and a rational , unaffected woman like Miss Taylor , may be safely left to manage their own concerns .',\n",
       " 'You are more likely to have done harm to yourself , than good to them , by interference .\"',\n",
       " '\" Emma never thinks of herself , if she can do good to others ,\" rejoined Mr . Woodhouse , understanding but in part .',\n",
       " '\" But , my dear , pray do not make any more matches ; they are silly things , and break up one \\' s family circle grievously .\"',\n",
       " '\" Only one more , papa ; only for Mr . Elton .',\n",
       " 'Poor Mr . Elton !',\n",
       " 'You like Mr . Elton , papa ,-- I must look about for a wife for him .',\n",
       " 'There is nobody in Highbury who deserves him -- and he has been here a whole year , and has fitted up his house so comfortably , that it would be a shame to have him single any longer -- and I thought when he was joining their hands to - day , he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office done for him !',\n",
       " 'I think very well of Mr . Elton , and this is the only way I have of doing him a service .\"',\n",
       " '\" Mr . Elton is a very pretty young man , to be sure , and a very good young man , and I have a great regard for him .',\n",
       " 'But if you want to shew him any attention , my dear , ask him to come and dine with us some day .',\n",
       " 'That will be a much better thing .',\n",
       " 'I dare say Mr . Knightley will be so kind as to meet him .\"',\n",
       " '\" With a great deal of pleasure , sir , at any time ,\" said Mr . Knightley , laughing , \" and I agree with you entirely , that it will be a much better thing .',\n",
       " 'Invite him to dinner , Emma , and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken , but leave him to chuse his own wife .',\n",
       " 'Depend upon it , a man of six or seven - and - twenty can take care of himself .\"',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER II',\n",
       " 'Mr . Weston was a native of Highbury , and born of a respectable family , which for the last two or three generations had been rising into gentility and property .',\n",
       " 'He had received a good education , but , on succeeding early in life to a small independence , had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged , and had satisfied an active , cheerful mind and social temper by entering into the militia of his county , then embodied .',\n",
       " 'Captain Weston was a general favourite ; and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill , of a great Yorkshire family , and Miss Churchill fell in love with him , nobody was surprized , except her brother and his wife , who had never seen him , and who were full of pride and importance , which the connexion would offend .',\n",
       " 'Miss Churchill , however , being of age , and with the full command of her fortune -- though her fortune bore no proportion to the family - estate -- was not to be dissuaded from the marriage , and it took place , to the infinite mortification of Mr . and Mrs . Churchill , who threw her off with due decorum .',\n",
       " 'It was an unsuitable connexion , and did not produce much happiness .',\n",
       " 'Mrs . Weston ought to have found more in it , for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him ; but though she had one sort of spirit , she had not the best .',\n",
       " \"She had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother , but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother ' s unreasonable anger , nor from missing the luxuries of her former home .\",\n",
       " 'They lived beyond their income , but still it was nothing in comparison of Enscombe : she did not cease to love her husband , but she wanted at once to be the wife of Captain Weston , and Miss Churchill of Enscombe .',\n",
       " \"Captain Weston , who had been considered , especially by the Churchills , as making such an amazing match , was proved to have much the worst of the bargain ; for when his wife died , after a three years ' marriage , he was rather a poorer man than at first , and with a child to maintain .\",\n",
       " 'From the expense of the child , however , he was soon relieved .',\n",
       " \"The boy had , with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his mother ' s , been the means of a sort of reconciliation ; and Mr . and Mrs . Churchill , having no children of their own , nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for , offered to take the whole charge of the little Frank soon after her decease .\",\n",
       " 'Some scruples and some reluctance the widower - father may be supposed to have felt ; but as they were overcome by other considerations , the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the Churchills , and he had only his own comfort to seek , and his own situation to improve as he could .',\n",
       " 'A complete change of life became desirable .',\n",
       " 'He quitted the militia and engaged in trade , having brothers already established in a good way in London , which afforded him a favourable opening .',\n",
       " 'It was a concern which brought just employment enough .',\n",
       " 'He had still a small house in Highbury , where most of his leisure days were spent ; and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society , the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away .',\n",
       " 'He had , by that time , realised an easy competence -- enough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining Highbury , which he had always longed for -- enough to marry a woman as portionless even as Miss Taylor , and to live according to the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition .',\n",
       " 'It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his schemes ; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth , it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase Randalls , and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to ; but he had gone steadily on , with these objects in view , till they were accomplished .',\n",
       " 'He had made his fortune , bought his house , and obtained his wife ; and was beginning a new period of existence , with every probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through .',\n",
       " 'He had never been an unhappy man ; his own temper had secured him from that , even in his first marriage ; but his second must shew him how delightful a well - judging and truly amiable woman could be , and must give him the pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen , to excite gratitude than to feel it .',\n",
       " \"He had only himself to please in his choice : his fortune was his own ; for as to Frank , it was more than being tacitly brought up as his uncle ' s heir , it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume the name of Churchill on coming of age .\",\n",
       " \"It was most unlikely , therefore , that he should ever want his father ' s assistance .\",\n",
       " 'His father had no apprehension of it .',\n",
       " \"The aunt was a capricious woman , and governed her husband entirely ; but it was not in Mr . Weston ' s nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear , and , as he believed , so deservedly dear .\",\n",
       " 'He saw his son every year in London , and was proud of him ; and his fond report of him as a very fine young man had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too .',\n",

       " 'He had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle ; his horror of late hours , and large dinner - parties , made him unfit for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms .',\n",
       " 'Fortunately for him , Highbury , including Randalls in the same parish , and Donwell Abbey in the parish adjoining , the seat of Mr . Knightley , comprehended many such .',\n",
       " \"Not unfrequently , through Emma ' s persuasion , he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him : but evening parties were what he preferred ; and , unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company , there was scarcely an evening in the week in which Emma could not make up a card - table for him .\",\n",
       " \"Real , long - standing regard brought the Westons and Mr . Knightley ; and by Mr . Elton , a young man living alone without liking it , the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of Mr . Woodhouse ' s drawing - room , and the smiles of his lovely daughter , was in no danger of being thrown away .\",\n",
       " 'After these came a second set ; among the most come - at - able of whom were Mrs . and Miss Bates , and Mrs . Goddard , three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from Hartfield , and who were fetched and carried home so often , that Mr . Woodhouse thought it no hardship for either James or the horses .',\n",
       " 'Had it taken place only once a year , it would have been a grievance .',\n",
       " 'Mrs . Bates , the widow of a former vicar of Highbury , was a very old lady , almost past every thing but tea and quadrille .',\n",
       " 'She lived with her single daughter in a very small way , and was considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady , under such untoward circumstances , can excite .',\n",
       " 'Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young , handsome , rich , nor married .',\n",
       " 'Miss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favour ; and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself , or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect .',\n",
       " 'She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness .',\n",
       " 'Her youth had passed without distinction , and her middle of life was devoted to the care of a failing mother , and the endeavour to make a small income go as far as possible .',\n",
       " 'And yet she was a happy woman , and a woman whom no one named without good - will .',\n",
       " 'It was her own universal good - will and contented temper which worked such wonders .',\n",
       " \"She loved every body , was interested in every body ' s happiness , quicksighted to every body ' s merits ; thought herself a most fortunate creature , and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother , and so many good neighbours and friends , and a home that wanted for nothing .\",\n",

       " \"Mrs . Goddard ' s school was in high repute -- and very deservedly ; for Highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy spot : she had an ample house and garden , gave the children plenty of wholesome food , let them run about a great deal in the summer , and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands .\",\n",
       " 'It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked after her to church .',\n",
       " \"She was a plain , motherly kind of woman , who had worked hard in her youth , and now thought herself entitled to the occasional holiday of a tea - visit ; and having formerly owed much to Mr . Woodhouse ' s kindness , felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat parlour , hung round with fancy - work , whenever she could , and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside .\",\n",
       " \"These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently able to collect ; and happy was she , for her father ' s sake , in the power ; though , as far as she was herself concerned , it was no remedy for the absence of Mrs . Weston .\",\n",
       " 'She was delighted to see her father look comfortable , and very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well ; but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated .',\n",
       " 'As she sat one morning , looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day , a note was brought from Mrs . Goddard , requesting , in most respectful terms , to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her ; a most welcome request : for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen , whom Emma knew very well by sight , and had long felt an interest in , on account of her beauty .',\n",
       " 'A very gracious invitation was returned , and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion .',\n",

       " 'She was short , plump , and fair , with a fine bloom , blue eyes , light hair , regular features , and a look of great sweetness , and , before the end of the evening , Emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person , and quite determined to continue the acquaintance .',\n",
       " \"She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith ' s conversation , but she found her altogether very engaging -- not inconveniently shy , not unwilling to talk -- and yet so far from pushing , shewing so proper and becoming a deference , seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to Hartfield , and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to , that she must have good sense , and deserve encouragement .\",\n",
       " 'Encouragement should be given .',\n",
       " 'Those soft blue eyes , and all those natural graces , should not be wasted on the inferior society of Highbury and its connexions .',\n",

       " 'The friends from whom she had just parted , though very good sort of people , must be doing her harm .',\n",
       " 'They were a family of the name of Martin , whom Emma well knew by character , as renting a large farm of Mr . Knightley , and residing in the parish of Donwell -- very creditably , she believed -- she knew Mr . Knightley thought highly of them -- but they must be coarse and unpolished , and very unfit to be the intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance to be quite perfect .',\n",
       " '_She_ would notice her ; she would improve her ; she would detach her from her bad acquaintance , and introduce her into good society ; she would form her opinions and her manners .',\n",
       " 'It would be an interesting , and certainly a very kind undertaking ; highly becoming her own situation in life , her leisure , and powers .',\n",
       " 'She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes , in talking and listening , and forming all these schemes in the in - betweens , that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate ; and the supper - table , which always closed such parties , and for which she had been used to sit and watch the due time , was all set out and ready , and moved forwards to the fire , before she was aware .',\n",
       " 'With an alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively , with the real good - will of a mind delighted with its own ideas , did she then do all the honours of the meal , and help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters , with an urgency which she knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests .',\n",
       " 'Upon such occasions poor Mr . Woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare .',\n",
       " 'He loved to have the cloth laid , because it had been the fashion of his youth , but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it ; and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing , his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat .',\n",
       " 'Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could , with thorough self - approbation , recommend ; though he might constrain himself , while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things , to say :',\n",

       " 'For some weeks past she had been spending more than half her time there , and gradually getting to have a bed - room appropriated to herself ; and Emma judged it best in every respect , safest and kindest , to keep her with them as much as possible just at present .',\n",
       " \"She was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or two to Mrs . Goddard ' s , but it was then to be settled that she should return to Hartfield , to make a regular visit of some days .\",\n",
       " 'While she was gone , Mr . Knightley called , and sat some time with Mr . Woodhouse and Emma , till Mr . Woodhouse , who had previously made up his mind to walk out , was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it , and was induced by the entreaties of both , though against the scruples of his own civility , to leave Mr . Knightley for that purpose .',\n",
       " 'Mr . Knightley , who had nothing of ceremony about him , was offering by his short , decided answers , an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies and civil hesitations of the other .',\n",
       " '\" Well , I believe , if you will excuse me , Mr . Knightley , if you will not consider me as doing a very rude thing , I shall take Emma \\' s advice and go out for a quarter of an hour .',\n",
       " 'As the sun is out , I believe I had better take my three turns while I can .',\n",
       " 'I treat you without ceremony , Mr . Knightley .',\n",
       " 'We invalids think we are privileged people .\"',\n",

       " '\" You cannot do better , sir .\"',\n",
       " '\" I would ask for the pleasure of your company , Mr . Knightley , but I am a very slow walker , and my pace would be tedious to you ; and , besides , you have another long walk before you , to Donwell Abbey .\"',\n",
       " '\" Thank you , sir , thank you ; I am going this moment myself ; and I think the sooner _you_ go the better .',\n",
       " 'I will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for you .\"',\n",
       " 'Mr . Woodhouse at last was off ; but Mr . Knightley , instead of being immediately off likewise , sat down again , seemingly inclined for more chat .',\n",
       " 'He began speaking of Harriet , and speaking of her with more voluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before .',\n",
       " '\" I cannot rate her beauty as you do ,\" said he ; \" but she is a pretty little creature , and I am inclined to think very well of her disposition .',\n",
       " 'Her character depends upon those she is with ; but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman .\"',\n",
       " '\" I am glad you think so ; and the good hands , I hope , may not be wanting .\"',\n",
       " '\" Come ,\" said he , \" you are anxious for a compliment , so I will tell you that you have improved her .',\n",
       " 'You have cured her of her school - girl \\' s giggle ; she really does you credit .\"',\n",
       " '\" Thank you .',\n",
       " 'I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I had been of some use ; but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they may .',\n",

       " '\" Something has happened to delay her ; some visitors perhaps .\"',\n",
       " '\" Highbury gossips !-- Tiresome wretches !\"',\n",
       " '\" Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would .\"',\n",
       " 'Emma knew this was too true for contradiction , and therefore said nothing .',\n",

       " '\" I do not pretend to fix on times or places , but I must tell you that I have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of something to her advantage .\"',\n",
       " '\" Indeed !',\n",

       " 'of what sort ?\"',\n",
       " '\" A very serious sort , I assure you ;\" still smiling .',\n",

       " 'Mr . Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser , and she knew Mr . Elton looked up to him .',\n",
       " '\" I have reason to think ,\" he replied , \" that Harriet Smith will soon have an offer of marriage , and from a most unexceptionable quarter :-- Robert Martin is the man .',\n",
       " 'Her visit to Abbey - Mill , this summer , seems to have done his business .',\n",
       " 'He is desperately in love and means to marry her .\"',\n",
       " '\" He is very obliging ,\" said Emma ; \" but is he sure that Harriet means to marry him ?\"',\n",
       " '\" Well , well , means to make her an offer then .',\n",
       " 'Will that do ?',\n",
       " 'He came to the Abbey two evenings ago , on purpose to consult me about it .',\n",
       " 'He knows I have a thorough regard for him and all his family , and , I believe , considers me as one of his best friends .',\n",
       " 'He came to ask me whether I thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early ; whether I thought her too young : in short , whether I approved his choice altogether ; having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered ( especially since _your_ making so much of her ) as in a line of society above him .',\n",
       " 'I was very much pleased with all that he said .',\n",
       " 'I never hear better sense from any one than Robert Martin .',\n",
       " 'He always speaks to the purpose ; open , straightforward , and very well judging .',\n",
       " 'He told me every thing ; his circumstances and plans , and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage .',\n",
       " 'He is an excellent young man , both as son and brother .',\n",
       " 'I had no hesitation in advising him to marry .',\n",
       " 'He proved to me that he could afford it ; and that being the case , I was convinced he could not do better .',\n",
       " 'I praised the fair lady too , and altogether sent him away very happy .',\n",
       " 'If he had never esteemed my opinion before , he would have thought highly of me then ; and , I dare say , left the house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had .',\n",
       " 'This happened the night before last .',\n",
       " 'Now , as we may fairly suppose , he would not allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady , and as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday , it is not unlikely that he should be at Mrs . Goddard \\' s to - day ; and she may be detained by a visitor , without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch .\"',\n",
       " '\" Pray , Mr . Knightley ,\" said Emma , who had been smiling to herself through a great part of this speech , \" how do you know that Mr . Martin did not speak yesterday ?\"',\n",
       " '\" Certainly ,\" replied he , surprized , \" I do not absolutely know it ; but it may be inferred .',\n",
       " 'Was not she the whole day with you ?\"',\n",
       " '\" Come ,\" said she , \" I will tell you something , in return for what you have told me .',\n",
       " 'He did speak yesterday -- that is , he wrote , and was refused .\"',\n",
       " 'This was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed ; and Mr . Knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure , as he stood up , in tall indignation , and said ,',\n",
       " '\" Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her .',\n",
       " 'What is the foolish girl about ?\"',\n",
       " '\" Oh !',\n",
       " 'to be sure ,\" cried Emma , \" it is always incomprehensible to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage .',\n",
       " 'A man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her .\"',\n",
       " '\" Nonsense !',\n",
       " 'a man does not imagine any such thing .',\n",
       " 'But what is the meaning of this ?',\n",
       " 'Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin ?',\n",
       " 'madness , if it is so ; but I hope you are mistaken .\"',\n",
       " '\" I saw her answer !-- nothing could be clearer .\"',\n",

       " \"Mr . Martin is a very respectable young man , but I cannot admit him to be Harriet ' s equal ; and am rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her .\",\n",
       " 'By your account , he does seem to have had some scruples .',\n",
       " 'It is a pity that they were ever got over .\"',\n",

       " 'She is pretty , and she is good tempered , and that is all .',\n",

       " 'But I could not reason so to a man in love , and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her , to her having that sort of disposition , which , in good hands , like his , might be easily led aright and turn out very well .',\n",
