# Project: PlotGEN
### By Hunter Gallant

---

**Concept**

Why would we hard-code a plotline structure? My idea is to have the computer look at a text, discern important plot information from it, and construct its own story from that.

**Outline**

1. Text Retrieval
2. Build plot structure
    - Plotline graphs
    - Qualitative plot descriptions
3. Generate new plot structure
4. Text generation based on new plot
5. Loop over this 10,000 times
6. Submit to NaNoGenMo
7. Profit?
